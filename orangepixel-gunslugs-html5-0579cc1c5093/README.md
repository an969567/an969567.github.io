# what is this #

This is the HTML5 version of Gunslugs - [www.gunslugs.com](http://www.gunslugs.com)

The HTML5 version is a port of the original code written in Java, and I used this build to release a ChromeOS version of the game. 

This code version is slightly outdated due to various bug fixes I did on the more common version, but it's still the full playable game as it was originally released

The game was originally released back in 2012, and is now available on iOS, Android / AndroidTV, Windows, Linux, MacOS (Steam/humblestore), PS Vita, Nintendo 3DS. You can even find a copy on Blackberry and Ouya devices.  

So if you enjoy this free source code, you can always grab a copy of the game on any of your favorite platforms as thanks ;)

# License #

I opted for the Creative commons BY-NC license. This basically means you can have fun with the code for learning purpose, tweak it around a bit, as long as you don't go commercial with it (making money from it) and with anything you do with it you have to mention it was originally created by Orangepixel - www.orangepixel.net

# what can we do with it#

Learn from it, laugh at it, ignore it, but mostly if you are a beginning game developer: modify the shit out of this code.. that's the best way to learn programming. Play the game, find something you think would be cool to change, and hunt down the part of the code that does that!
Don't worry about how something "should" be done, the key to creating games is writing code that does what you want it to do. Improving, simplifying, enhancing, or optimizing all comes later.

Note of warning: don't look at this as THE way to create games.. this isn't my best code, it's even extremely messy, but in the end it does get the job done! 

# HOW!? #

It's HTML5! All you need is a text editor or your favorite development environment, and start digging through the code.  To try the game, simply open the index.htm file in your browser (ChromeOS works best, but it should work decent in Firefox, Safari, and maybe even browsers made by Microsoft)

Sound effects will only work if you run the game from a file-server, and not if you run the game from the file-explorer. The code will detect it and just go in silent mode so it won't spawn a bunch of error messages either.
